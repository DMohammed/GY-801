# GY-801
IMU 10DOF L3G4200D+ADXL345+HMC5883L+BMP180 in development 

In some of gy-801 IC HMC5883L doesn't work and show address 0x30 and don't have any datasheet for it by testing blindly somehow get data from register.
if I got datasheet for this part fix code base on that until that time you are can use this code.
